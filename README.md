FreeStore
=========

This is a web application for the Twice Blessed Free Store in Cleveland, Ohio.  The code is meant to
be general enough that it can be re-used by other free stores in the future.

The code is primarily in Python and Bottle, with the database being Postgresql.
It also uses RactiveJs and Bootstrap on the front end.

Basically the application has the following actions available:
- Register customers and their dependents.
- Check in customers.
- Check out customers.
- Run reports for customers, dependents, visits, and more.
- Create and edit users in the system.
